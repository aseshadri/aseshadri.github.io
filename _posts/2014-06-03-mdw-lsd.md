When the weather's great…and your friends are great…you almost have no choice but spend time outside with them. So we did. We packed a picnic and headed to Waveland Park off Lake Shore Drive and had friends join us for drinking, eating, chatting, frisbeeing, and kite flying. It was a perfect Memorial Day Weekend afternoon.
