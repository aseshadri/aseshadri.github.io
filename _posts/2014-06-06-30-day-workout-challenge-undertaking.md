We're going to Costa Rica! And what better reason to get my ass in gear, so to speak. Don't get me wrong. I'm not especially interested in having a "bikini-ready bod". I'm not sure any amount of working out will affect my comfort level in covering so little of my body in public. But it would be nice not to feel extra squishy and self conscious. Especially when seated (a super flattering angle for my belly) for hours on a plane. Plus, with the weather (finally) warming up, it'd be nice to fit comfortably into my summer dresses and shorts and not have to buy a whole new wardrobe.

So this is what we have to work with. Not too terrible, but not great. And it's definitely been better. My wedding and the weeks after have not been the best for my waistline. I'm usually pretty decent about exercise: I go to yoga a few times a week, take weekly ballet classes, and run when I can make myself. Letting that lapse and eating entirely comfort food have taken their toll. And, to clarify, I'm not down on myself or my body for the current state of this. I'm definitely in agreement with [this](http://dailyoftheday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/480900_451243814958361_1530752660_n.jpg) definition of a bikini body. I just like the clothes I already have and want to fit into/feel good in them again.

So this is what I'm going to do about it:

Wish me luck!
